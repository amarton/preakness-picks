Sagamore Development, this month asked the city to contribute $535 million toward parks, roads, utilities, bike lanes and other infrastructure in Port Covington


The project is estimated to cost $5.5 billion, including $1.4 billion for infrastructure.

The city's contribution would pay for improvements that include a $19.7 million eastern waterfront park; $17.6 million in changes to Key Highway; a $26 million "archaeological pier" and a $15.3 million pedestrian swing bridge connecting to Westport, according to a project list shown to the Board of Finance on Monday.

In addition to the city's $535 million, Sagamore is seeking about $574 million in federal and state funding for transportation projects for the area, where they want to create a new Light Rail spur and new highway access.

Baltimore's money would come from bonds issued by the city, which are repaid with new property taxes generated by the project, a mechanism known as tax increment financing or TIFs.
